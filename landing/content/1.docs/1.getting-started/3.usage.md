This guide covers the essential workflows in LegalEase AI, from uploading documents to performing advanced searches and transcribing audio files.

## Quick Start

After installation, navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to access the LegalEase AI interface. The platform is ready to use immediately—no additional configuration required.

## Managing Cases

Cases help you organize documents into logical groups for focused research and analysis.

### Creating a Case

1. Navigate to the **Cases** page
2. Click **New Case**
3. Enter a case name and optional description
4. Click **Create**

### Loading Cases

You can load multiple cases simultaneously to include their documents in your search scope:

1. Go to the **Cases** page
2. Toggle the switch next to each case you want to load
3. Loaded cases are immediately available for searching

### Organizing Documents

Documents can be organized into cases during upload or moved between cases later. This flexibility lets you restructure your document library as your research evolves.

## Uploading Documents

LegalEase AI supports bulk document upload with automatic processing.

### Bulk Upload

1. Navigate to the **Documents** page or a specific case
2. Click **Upload Documents** or drag files directly onto the page
3. Select one or more PDF files
4. (Optional) Select a case to organize documents
5. Click **Upload**

### Processing Pipeline

After upload, documents go through an automated processing pipeline:

1. **Storage**: Files are stored in MinIO object storage
2. **Parsing**: Docling extracts text, structure, and bounding boxes
3. **Chunking**: Content is split into semantic chunks (sections, paragraphs, tables)
4. **Embedding**: Chunks are embedded using Sentence Transformers
5. **Indexing**: Text is indexed for BM25 search, vectors stored in Qdrant
6. **Analysis**: Entities are extracted, summaries generated (optional)

You can track processing status in real-time on the Documents page.

## Searching Documents

LegalEase AI's hybrid search engine combines keyword matching with semantic understanding for powerful, flexible search.

### Basic Search

1. Navigate to the **Search** page
2. Enter your search query in the search bar
3. Press Enter or click the search icon
4. Results appear instantly with relevance scores

### Advanced Filtering

Use filters to narrow search results:

- **Case Filter**: Search within specific cases or across all documents
- **Document Type**: Filter by contracts, briefs, pleadings, correspondence, etc.
- **Chunk Type**: Focus on titles, sections, paragraphs, tables, or lists

### Viewing Results

Each search result shows:
- Matching text snippet with context
- Document name and metadata
- Relevance score (hybrid BM25 + semantic)
- Source document type and case

Click any result to open the document viewer and jump directly to the highlighted section.

## PDF Viewer

The integrated PDF viewer provides a seamless document review experience.

### Navigation

- **Scroll** to move through pages
- **Click and drag** to pan large pages
- **Zoom** using the toolbar controls or mouse wheel
- **Search** within the document using Ctrl/Cmd+F

### Highlighting

When you click a search result, the PDF viewer:
1. Opens the source document
2. Jumps to the relevant page
3. Highlights the matching text with a colored bounding box
4. Displays surrounding context

### Printing

Use the **Print** button in the toolbar to print documents directly from the viewer.

## Audio Transcription

LegalEase AI includes powerful audio transcription with speaker diarization.

### Uploading Audio Files

1. Navigate to the **Transcriptions** page
2. Click **Upload Audio**
3. Select an audio file (WAV, MP3, M4A, FLAC, OGG)
4. (Optional) Link to a document or case
5. Click **Upload**

### Transcription Process

Audio files are processed automatically:

1. **Upload**: Files stored in MinIO
2. **Transcription**: WhisperX converts speech to text (70x real-time)
3. **Diarization**: Speakers are identified and separated
4. **Timestamps**: Word-level timestamps added
5. **Analysis**: AI infers speaker names from context (optional)

Processing 1 hour of audio typically takes 50-60 seconds.

### Viewing Transcripts

The transcript viewer provides:

- **Full Text**: Complete transcript with timestamps
- **Speaker Labels**: Color-coded speakers with editable names
- **Search**: Find specific words or phrases within the transcript
- **Statistics**: Talk time and contribution metrics per speaker
- **Playback Sync**: Click timestamps to jump to audio position (if audio player integrated)

### Editing Speaker Names

1. Open a transcript
2. Click on any speaker label
3. Enter a new name or select from AI-suggested names
4. Changes apply to all instances of that speaker

### Exporting Transcripts

Export transcripts in multiple formats:

- **DOCX**: Formatted document with speaker labels
- **SRT/VTT**: Subtitle formats with timestamps
- **JSON**: Structured data for programmatic use

Click the **Export** button and select your preferred format.

## AI-Powered Analysis

### Document Summaries

LegalEase AI can automatically generate summaries using local LLM models:

1. Open a document
2. Click **Summarize** in the toolbar
3. Wait for the AI to generate a summary (10-30 seconds)
4. View, edit, or export the summary

Summaries are generated using Llama 3.1 running locally via Ollama—no external API calls.

### Entity Extraction

Entities (names, dates, amounts, citations) are automatically extracted during document processing. View extracted entities:

1. Open a document
2. Navigate to the **Entities** tab
3. Browse by entity type
4. Click entities to see all mentions in the document

### Knowledge Graphs

Visualize relationships between entities:

1. Navigate to the **Knowledge Graph** page
2. Select a case or document set
3. View interactive graph powered by Neo4j and Cytoscape.js
4. Click nodes to explore entity details
5. Follow edges to understand relationships

## Common Workflows

### Research Workflow

1. Create a case for your research topic
2. Upload relevant documents to the case
3. Load the case to focus searches
4. Perform hybrid searches with advanced filters
5. Review results in the PDF viewer
6. Extract key entities and generate summaries

### Deposition Review Workflow

1. Upload deposition audio file
2. Wait for automatic transcription and diarization
3. Review transcript and edit speaker names
4. Search for key terms or statements
5. Export transcript segments for quotes
6. Link transcript to related case documents

### Citation Analysis Workflow

1. Upload multiple related documents
2. Wait for entity extraction and processing
3. Open the Knowledge Graph
4. Explore citation networks visually
5. Identify frequently cited cases or statutes
6. Follow citation chains to find precedents

## Tips for Best Results

### Search Tips

- Use specific legal terms for better precision
