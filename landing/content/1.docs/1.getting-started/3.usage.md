With the services online, you can start managing cases, processing documents, running searches, and working with transcripts. The sections below cover the most common flows.

## Create a case

1. Open the **Cases** page.
2. Click **New Case** and provide a name, case number, client, and optional matter type.
3. Newly created cases start in `STAGING`. Activate them when you are ready to ingest material.

Cases automatically receive a dedicated MinIO bucket and Qdrant collection naming convention. These resources allow you to unload/archived cases later without touching other data.

## Upload documents

1. From the case detail view or the central **Documents** page, use the **Upload** button.
2. Drop PDFs, DOCX, plain text, or image files. Multiple uploads are supported.
3. The backend stores the originals in MinIO and enqueues processing jobs.
4. Processing steps:
   - Docling parses the file, optionally running OCR where needed.
   - A hierarchical chunker creates `summary`, `section`, and `microblock` slices with bounding boxes.
   - FastEmbed generates dense vectors, BM25 produces sparse vectors, and both are written to Qdrant.
   - Page preview images are rendered for PDFs and stored under `documents/<case>/<doc>/pages/…`.
5. Once finished, the document status changes to `COMPLETED` and the PDF viewer allows navigation with highlight overlays.

## Search across cases

1. Head to the **Search** page.
2. Enter a query – keywords, natural language, or both.
3. Adjust filters as needed:
   - Choose **Hybrid**, **Semantic**, or **Keyword** modes.
   - Limit by case, document types, or chunk type (summary/section/microblock/transcript segments).
   - Switch off transcript results if you only need documents.
4. Results list metadata including score, chunk type, and case ID. Selecting a result opens the associated document at the highlighted location.
5. Use the debug drawer (toggle in the UI) to inspect the raw metadata, including BM25 and dense scores, for tuning.

## Work with transcripts

1. Navigate to **Transcripts**.
2. Click **Upload Recording** and choose a case plus one or more audio/video files.
3. Pick optional settings (task: transcribe or translate, diarisation toggle, speaker range).
4. The worker:
   - Pre-processes audio with FFmpeg.
   - Attempts WhisperX transcription (GPU path) when installed.
   - Falls back to the bundled Whisper API integration if WhisperX is unavailable.
   - Applies Pyannote diarisation when `HF_TOKEN` is set, otherwise a lightweight heuristic diariser.
5. Once complete, the transcript page shows segments, allows filtering by speaker, and supports export to DOCX/SRT/VTT/TXT/JSON.
6. Trigger a summary from the sidebar to enqueue an Ollama job that produces executive summaries, key moments, timelines, and speaker statistics.

## Scan forensic exports

1. Set `FORENSIC_EXPORTS_PATH` in `.env` to a host directory containing Cellebrite/AXIOM exports.
2. From a case, choose **Scan Forensic Export** and supply the subdirectory you want to index.
3. The backend walks the directory, looks for `ExportSummary.json` + `Report.html`, and registers findings.
4. Browse exports and their file listings within the dashboard.

## Monitor background jobs

- **Dashboard widgets** show the number of items currently processing.
- Use `docker compose logs -f worker` to watch Celery output in real time.
- The `/api/v1/transcriptions/{id}/summary/status/{task_id}` endpoint reports summarisation progress; similar status endpoints exist for other long-running tasks.

## Housekeeping tips

- Use `make down` when pausing work; volumes persist data.
- `RESET.md` documents how to rebuild the environment with sample PDFs/audio.
- For new releases, pull updated images (`docker compose pull`) and rerun `make migrate`.
