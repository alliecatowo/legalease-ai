With LegalEase running, you can start managing cases, processing documents, running transcriptions, and searching across your content. This guide covers the most common workflows.

## Create a Case

Cases are the primary organizational unit in LegalEase. All documents and transcripts belong to a case.

1. Open the **Cases** page from the sidebar
2. Click **New Case**
3. Fill in the required fields:
   - **Name** - Descriptive title for the case
   - **Case Number** - Your internal reference number
   - **Client** - Client name or identifier
   - **Matter Type** - Optional category (litigation, contract, etc.)
4. Click **Create** to save

Cases start in `active` status. You can archive cases when work is complete.

## Upload Documents

LegalEase processes PDFs and other documents through Docling for text extraction, chunking, and vector indexing.

1. Navigate to a case or the **Documents** page
2. Click **Upload** and select files (PDF, DOCX, images)
3. Documents enter `processing` status while:
   - Docling extracts text, tables, and structure
   - Pages are chunked into searchable segments
   - Vector embeddings are generated and indexed in Qdrant
   - Page renders are created for the PDF viewer
4. Once complete, status changes to `completed`

### Document Viewer

Click any document to open the viewer:

- Navigate pages with thumbnails or keyboard arrows
- Search hits are highlighted with bounding boxes from the original extraction
- Sidebar shows extracted entities and metadata
- Toggle between text and visual layers

## Transcribe Audio/Video

Upload audio or video files to generate AI-powered transcripts with speaker diarization.

1. Navigate to **Transcripts** or a case detail page
2. Click **Upload Recording**
3. Select your audio/video file (MP3, WAV, MP4, etc.)
4. The file uploads to Firebase Storage and processing begins:
   - Gemini 2.5 Flash (or Chirp 3) transcribes the audio
   - Speakers are identified and labeled
   - Speaker names are inferred from conversational context
   - Timestamps are assigned to each segment
5. Once complete, view the full transcript

### Transcript Viewer

The transcript page provides rich interaction:

- **Audio player** - Play/pause with waveform visualization (in progress)
- **Segment navigation** - Click any segment to jump to that timestamp
- **Speaker filtering** - Show only specific speakers
- **Edit speakers** - Rename speakers for clarity
- **Key moments** - AI-identified important points in the conversation
- **Summary** - Executive summary, topics, and action items

### Summarization

Transcripts are automatically summarized using Gemini:

- **Executive summary** - 1-2 paragraph overview
- **Key moments** - Timestamped highlights with importance ratings
- **Action items** - Follow-up tasks mentioned in the conversation
- **Topics** - Main subjects discussed
- **Entities** - People, organizations, locations, and dates mentioned

## Search Across Content

LegalEase provides hybrid search combining semantic understanding with keyword matching.

1. Open the **Search** page
2. Enter your query - natural language works best
3. Optionally filter by:
   - **Case** - Limit to specific cases
   - **Document type** - Documents, transcripts, or both
   - **Search mode** - Hybrid (default), semantic-only, or keyword-only
4. Results show:
   - Matching text with context
   - Source document/transcript
   - Relevance score
   - Case assignment

Click any result to navigate directly to that location in the document or transcript.

### Search Tips

- Use natural language: "What did the witness say about the contract date?"
- Combine keywords for precision: "Smith deposition damages"
- Filter by case when working on a specific matter
- Toggle search modes to compare results

## Case Management

### Archive Cases

When a case is complete:

1. Open the case detail page
2. Click the **Archive** button
3. Archived cases are hidden from the default list but remain searchable

### Restore Archived Cases

1. Use the filter to show archived cases
2. Open the case and click **Restore**

### Case Statistics

Each case shows:
- Total documents and their processing status
- Total transcripts and duration
- Recent activity

## Export Content

Export transcripts in various formats (feature in progress):

- **DOCX** - Word document with speaker labels and timestamps
- **SRT** - Subtitle format for video players
- **VTT** - Web video text tracks
- **TXT** - Plain text transcript
- **JSON** - Structured data with all metadata

## Monitor Background Jobs

Processing happens asynchronously via Firebase Cloud Functions:

- **Document status** - Watch the document card for status updates
- **Transcript status** - Real-time updates as transcription progresses
- **Function logs** - Check Firebase Emulator UI (http://localhost:4000) for detailed logs

Firestore triggers ensure status updates appear in real-time without page refresh.
