This guide will walk you through installing LegalEase AI on your infrastructure. The entire setup process takes about 10-15 minutes and requires minimal configuration.

## Prerequisites

Before installing LegalEase AI, ensure you have the following:

### Required Software

- **[mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/)** - Dev tools, environments, and task runner
- **Docker Engine 24.0+** with Docker Compose V2
- **Git** - Version control

### System Requirements

- **RAM**: Minimum 8GB (16GB recommended for optimal performance)
- **Disk Space**: At least 20GB available
- **CPU**: Multi-core processor (4+ cores recommended)
- **GPU (Optional)**: NVIDIA CUDA or AMD ROCm for accelerated AI processing

### Port Requirements

LegalEase AI uses the following ports by default:
- `3000` - Frontend application
- `8000` - Backend API
- `5432` - PostgreSQL database
- `6333` - Qdrant vector database
- `7474` - Neo4j browser interface
- `7687` - Neo4j bolt protocol
- `9000` - MinIO API
- `9001` - MinIO console
- `6379` - Redis
- `11434` - Ollama API

Ensure these ports are available on your system.

## Installing mise

If you don't have mise installed, you can install it using the official installer:

```bash
curl https://mise.run | sh
```

Or use your package manager:

::code-group
```bash [macOS]
brew install mise
```

```bash [Ubuntu/Debian]
apt install mise
```

```bash [Arch Linux]
pacman -S mise
```

```bash [Fedora]
dnf install mise
```
::

After installation, activate mise in your shell:

::code-group
```bash [Bash]
echo 'eval "$(mise activate bash)"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

```bash [Zsh]
echo 'eval "$(mise activate zsh)"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

```bash [Fish]
echo 'mise activate fish | source' >> ~/.config/fish/config.fish
source ~/.config/fish/config.fish
```
::

## Installation Steps

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AlliecatOwO/legalease-ai.git
cd legalease-ai
```

### 2. Quick Setup (Recommended)

The fastest way to get started is with the `setup` command, which handles everything in one step:

```bash
mise run setup
```

This command will:
- Start all Docker services (PostgreSQL, Qdrant, Neo4j, MinIO, Redis, Ollama)
- Pull required Ollama AI models (Llama 3.1)
- Run database migrations
- Initialize the system

The setup process typically takes 5-10 minutes, depending on your internet connection and hardware.

### 3. Manual Setup (Alternative)

If you prefer more control, you can run each step individually:

```bash
# Start all Docker services
mise run up

# Download AI models (this may take several minutes)
mise run setup:models

# Run database migrations
mise run migrate
```

## Accessing LegalEase AI

Once installation is complete, you can access the platform:

- **Frontend Application**: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- **API Documentation**: [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)
- **MinIO Console**: [http://localhost:9001](http://localhost:9001)
  - Username: `legalease`
  - Password: `legalease_dev_secret`
- **Neo4j Browser**: [http://localhost:7474](http://localhost:7474)
  - Username: `neo4j`
  - Password: `legalease_dev`

## Verifying Installation

To verify that all services are running correctly:

```bash
mise run ps
```

You should see all services (frontend, backend, worker, postgres, qdrant, neo4j, minio, redis, ollama) in a healthy state.

## GPU Support

### NVIDIA CUDA

If you have an NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support, Ollama will automatically detect and use it for accelerated AI inference. No additional configuration is required.

### AMD ROCm

For AMD GPUs, LegalEase AI includes ROCm support. Make sure you have ROCm drivers installed on your host system, and the Docker containers will use GPU acceleration.

## Next Steps

Now that LegalEase AI is installed, check out the [Usage Guide](/docs/getting-started/usage) to learn how to:
- Upload and process documents
- Perform hybrid searches
- Transcribe audio files
- Create and manage cases
- Use AI-powered analysis tools
