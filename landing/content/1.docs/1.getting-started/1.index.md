LegalEase is an end-to-end workspace for self-hosted legal research. It collects documents, transcripts, and forensic exports in a single place, enriches them with local processing jobs, and serves a Nuxt dashboard backed by a FastAPI API.

## What ships today

- **Case-centric document intake** – upload files into cases, monitor Celery processing, and browse the resulting chunks in the built-in PDF viewer.
- **Hybrid search engine** – fuse BM25 and dense vectors stored in Qdrant. Filter by case, document type, or chunk granularity and inspect metadata for every hit.
- **Transcription workflow** – ingest audio/video, run WhisperX if you have a GPU, fall back to whisper-api + heuristics otherwise, and generate Ollama-powered summaries and key moments.
- **Forensic exports** – catalogue Cellebrite/AXIOM exports by pointing LegalEase at a mounted evidence directory.
- **Local-first AI** – everything runs through your own infrastructure. The only outbound traffic happens when you choose to pull container images or Ollama models.

## Architecture at a glance

| Layer | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| Nuxt 4 dashboard | Frontend experience, search UI, transcript viewer |
| FastAPI backend | REST API, authentication placeholder, task orchestration |
| Celery worker | Long running jobs for document parsing, transcription, summarisation |
| PostgreSQL | Authoritative relational store |
| Qdrant | Vector search for document chunks and transcript segments |
| MinIO | Object storage for raw uploads, derived artefacts, and page renders |
| Redis | Cache + Celery broker/result backend |
| Ollama | Local LLM inference (summaries, tagging) |

## Status of advanced features

Some features are present in the codebase but still under active development:

- **Entity extraction & knowledge graph** – data models and services exist, but production-ready UX/API integration is pending.
- **Analytics dashboards** – front-end pages currently display placeholder data until the associated backend endpoints are completed.
- **Role-based access control** – authentication and multi-tenant support are still on the roadmap.

We keep documentation honest about these gaps so you can plan your deployment accordingly.
