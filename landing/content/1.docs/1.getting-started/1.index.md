LegalEase AI combines modern AI technologies with a privacy-first architecture to deliver:

- **Lightning-Fast Search**: Hybrid search combining BM25 keyword matching with semantic vector search for sub-100ms results
- **Smart Case Management**: Organize documents into cases with bulk upload, automatic processing, and real-time status tracking
- **Audio Transcription**: 70x real-time transcription with speaker diarization and word-level timestamps
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Document summarization, entity extraction, knowledge graphs, and citation networks
- **Modern Interface**: Built with Nuxt 4 and Nuxt UI 4 for a beautiful, responsive experience
- **Complete Privacy**: 100% local processing using Ollama, PostgreSQL, Qdrant, Neo4j, and MinIO

## Key Features

### Hybrid Search Engine
Lightning-fast hybrid search combining BM25 keyword matching with semantic vector search. Click results to jump directly to highlighted sections in PDFs with precise bounding boxes. Sub-100ms latency for instant results.

### Smart Case Management
Organize documents into cases with load/unload capabilities. Bulk upload with drag-and-drop, automatic processing pipelines, and real-time status tracking. Filter searches by case for focused research.

### AI Transcription
Process audio files at 70x real-time speed with speaker diarization and word-level timestamps. Export to DOCX, SRT/VTT, or JSON. Process 1 hour of audio in approximately 50 seconds.

### AI-Powered Analysis
- **Auto-Summarization**: LLM-generated document and transcript summaries using local Llama 3.1 models
- **Entity Extraction**: Identify parties, dates, amounts, and citations using GLiNER and LexNLP
- **Smart Tagging**: Automatic document categorization and metadata extraction
- **Knowledge Graphs**: Visualize entity relationships and citation networks with Neo4j

### Modern UI
Built with Nuxt 4 and Nuxt UI 4. Native PDF viewer with search highlighting, responsive design, dark/light modes, and real-time updates. Cytoscape.js powers interactive knowledge graph visualization.

### Privacy & Security
100% local processing with no external APIs. All data stays on your infrastructure. Uses local Ollama models (Llama 3.1). Complete control over PostgreSQL, MinIO, Qdrant, and Neo4j storage.
