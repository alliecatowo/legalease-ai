The Docker stack is the fastest way to evaluate LegalEase, but you can run services locally for development or integration testing. This guide covers common scenarios.

## Repository layout

```
backend/      FastAPI API, Celery worker, pipelines
frontend/     Nuxt 4 dashboard
landing/      Marketing + documentation site
docker/       Container Dockerfiles
scripts/      Utilities and seeding helpers
```

## Backend development

### Install dependencies

```bash
cd backend
uv sync                  # creates .venv with project dependencies
```

### Database migrations

```bash
uv run alembic upgrade head
uv run alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Describe change"
```

### Run the API with hot reload

```bash
uv run uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

### Run Celery worker and beat

```bash
uv run celery -A app.workers.celery_app worker --loglevel=info
uv run celery -A app.workers.celery_app beat --loglevel=info
```

Make sure infrastructure services (Postgres, Redis, Qdrant, MinIO, Ollama) are running. You can reuse the Docker Compose stack for them:

```bash
make up-infra
```

Set environment variables (e.g., `DATABASE_URL`, `MINIO_ENDPOINT`) so the host processes talk to the containers.

## Frontend development

```bash
cd frontend
pnpm install
NUXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE=http://localhost:8000 pnpm dev
```

Linting is wired via `pnpm lint`. Some pages still contain placeholder data (analytics, knowledge graph); tailor them once the backend endpoints land.

## Landing site

```bash
cd landing
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

The site uses Nuxt Content; editing markdown/yaml files triggers hot reloads.

## Testing

- Backend: `uv run pytest` locally, or `docker compose exec backend pytest` in the container.
- Linting: Ruff (`uv run ruff check backend/app`) and mypy (`uv run mypy app`) configs are included.
- Frontend: run `pnpm lint`. Unit/component tests are not yet implemented.

## Debugging tips

- Enable verbose logging by setting `LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` in `backend/.env`.
- Inspect Qdrant state with `docker compose exec qdrant qdrant-cli collection list`.
- Use the MinIO console to confirm uploads appear under the expected prefixes.
- Celery exposes task status endpoints; use them to build custom progress indicators.

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch.
2. Keep documentation updates factualâ€”flag experimental areas explicitly.
3. Run linting/tests relevant to your change.
4. Open a PR with a summary of the behaviour change and manual testing steps.

We welcome additions to pipelines, better analytics, authentication, and documentation improvements.
