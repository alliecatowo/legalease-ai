The transcription pipeline now runs end-to-end inside LegalEase. Upload audio or video, monitor Celery progress, and receive transcripts with speaker labels and timestamped segments.

**Highlights**

- WhisperX is the primary engine (CUDA and ROCm friendly). When it is not available, LegalEase falls back to the official Whisper API or lightweight heuristics.
- Speaker diarisation uses Pyannote when an `HF_TOKEN` is configured, and gracefully falls back to pause-based speaker detection otherwise.
- Download transcripts as DOCX, SRT, VTT, TXT, or JSON from the dashboard.
- Celery task status endpoints expose progress so you can build custom indicators in downstream tools.

**Notes**

Actual throughput depends heavily on your hardware. Expect real-time or faster on modern GPUs, and slower performance on CPU-only environments. No audio leaves your infrastructure unless you opt into the Whisper API fallback.
