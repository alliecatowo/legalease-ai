🔍 Finding the right information just got a whole lot easier! We've completely revamped our search experience with powerful new filtering capabilities that put you in control.

Our hybrid search engine combines BM25 keyword matching with semantic vector search for the best of both worlds. Now, with advanced filters, you can narrow results by case, document type, and chunk type to zero in on exactly what you need.

**New Filter Options:**
- 📁 **Case Filter**: Search within specific cases or across your entire library
- 📄 **Document Type Filter**: Filter by contracts, briefs, pleadings, correspondence, and more
- 🧩 **Chunk Type Filter**: Focus on titles, sections, paragraphs, tables, or lists
- 🎯 **Combined Filtering**: Stack filters for surgical precision
- 🔄 **Real-time Updates**: Instant results as you adjust filters
- 💾 **Filter Persistence**: Your preferences are remembered

**Enhanced Search UI:** 🎨
We've added a prominent filter bar with an intuitive design that makes complex searches simple. The new hero page showcases search capabilities front and center, and we've resolved CSR hydration issues for a smoother experience.

**Performance:**
Sub-100ms search latency maintained even with complex filter combinations. All processing happens locally with no external API dependencies.

Search smarter, not harder with LegalEase AI's advanced filtering! ⚡
