The search interface now mirrors the flexibility of the backend hybrid engine.

**Highlights**

- Filter by case IDs, document IDs, or both to narrow the scope of each query.
- Select which chunk granularities to include (summary, section, microblock, transcript segment) so you can focus on either high-level summaries or precise snippets.
- Switch between hybrid, dense-only, and keyword-only retrieval strategies from the UI without modifying backend settings.
- View `_score_debug` metadata on each result to understand how BM25 and dense scores were fused.

**Developer conveniences**

- Debounced input prevents unnecessary API calls while typing.
- The search panel logs the final request payload to the browser console in development mode, making it easy to replay queries via cURL or the API docs.
