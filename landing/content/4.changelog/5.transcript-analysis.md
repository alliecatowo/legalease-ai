Transcript review now goes beyond raw text dumps.

**What you can do**

- Search within a transcript, filter by speaker, and toggle segment visibility.
- Generate an Ollama-backed summary that includes an executive overview, key moments, timeline, speaker statistics, action items, and topic tags.
- Regenerate summaries on demand or run batch jobs across multiple transcripts.
- Mark important segments as key moments; metadata is stored in the database for later retrieval.

**Integration perks**

- Transcript segments share the main Qdrant collection, so a single query can surface both document and transcript hits.
- Download caption files (SRT/VTT) or a polished DOCX with speaker formatting for further editing.

This release lays the groundwork for deeper analytics while keeping everything self-hosted.
