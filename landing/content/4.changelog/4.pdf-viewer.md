📄 We've given our PDF viewer a significant upgrade! Based on user feedback, we've added essential features and fixed navigation issues to make document review smoother and more efficient.

The new PDF viewer brings professional-grade functionality to LegalEase AI, with features you'd expect from dedicated PDF applications—all integrated seamlessly into your workflow.

**New Features:**
- 🖨️ **Print Button**: Print documents directly from the viewer
- 🖱️ **Mouse Panning**: Click and drag to navigate large documents
- 🎯 **Bounding Box Highlights**: Search results highlighted with precise bounding boxes
- 🎨 **Streamlined Toolbar**: Cleaner interface with improved control layout
- 🔄 **Synced Controls**: Page navigation and zoom stay in sync across all views
- 📍 **Jump to Results**: Click search results to jump directly to highlighted sections

**Bug Fixes:** 🐛
- Fixed duplicate toolbar rendering issue
- Resolved tab navigation conflicts on document pages
- Fixed UDashboardPanel slot rendering issues
- Improved Vue-PDF integration for better performance
- Eliminated control desync between different viewer instances

**Technical Improvements:** 🛠️
We've switched from raw PDF.js to vue-pdf-embed for better Vue 3 compatibility and smoother rendering. The new architecture supports hybrid search with precise bounding box coordinates, making it easy to locate relevant sections visually.

Your documents, beautifully rendered and easily navigable! 📑
