The built-in PDF viewer has been refreshed to work hand-in-hand with the new document pipeline.

**What's new**

- Bounding boxes from Docling are now honoured in the UI, so clicking a search result jumps to the exact location within the PDF.
- Page thumbnails, zoom, and keyboard navigation stay in sync, avoiding the desynchronisation issues present in earlier builds.
- MinIO-backed page renders load progressively, making large documents responsive even when running remotely.
- Toolbar controls were simplified; print, download, and jump-to-result actions now live in a single toolbar.

These changes make reviewing lengthy filings and exhibits significantly smoother without relying on external PDF tooling.
