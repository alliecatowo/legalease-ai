👥 Take your transcriptions to the next level with advanced speaker diarization! LegalEase AI now automatically identifies different speakers in your audio files and separates their dialogue with precision.

Our AI-powered system doesn't just detect speakers—it attempts to infer their names from context, saving you valuable time in post-processing. Each speaker gets a unique color for easy visual distinction, and you can edit names at any time.

**Key Features:**
- 🎤 Automatic speaker detection and separation
- 🤖 AI-powered speaker name inference from context
- 🎨 Color-coded speaker identification for clarity
- ✏️ Editable speaker names and labels
- 📊 Speaker statistics and talk-time analysis
- 🎯 Improved accuracy with configurable number of speakers
- 🔧 Advanced smoothing for cleaner speaker transitions

**Enhanced Accuracy:** 🎯
We've implemented num_speakers configuration and temporal smoothing to dramatically improve diarization accuracy. The system now handles overlapping speech and quick speaker changes more reliably, ensuring clean separation even in complex multi-party conversations.

**Real-World Applications:**
Essential for depositions with multiple witnesses, board meetings, panel discussions, and client consultations. Quickly identify who made specific statements and generate speaker-attributed transcripts for legal records.

Make every voice count with intelligent speaker diarization! 🎙️
