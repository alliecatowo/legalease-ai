We refined how LegalEase labels speakers inside transcripts:

- Configure minimum and maximum speaker counts when uploading a recording. This helps Pyannote converge faster on the right number of participants.
- When Pyannote is unavailable, a heuristic diariser detects speaker switches based on pauses and merges overly short segments to reduce flicker.
- The transcript viewer now colour-codes speakers consistently and lets you rename them inline; updates apply to all occurrences.
- Speaker statistics (total talk time and contribution percentage) are calculated alongside summary generation.

These tweaks make multi-party hearings and interviews easier to review even without cloud-based diarisation services.
