LegalEase’s core search stack is in place:

- Documents are parsed by Docling, chunked into multi-scale segments, and indexed with both dense embeddings and BM25 sparse vectors.
- Qdrant handles named vectors so hybrid queries can combine multiple granularities (summary/section/microblock) in a single request.
- Reciprocal Rank Fusion is the default strategy, balancing keyword hits with semantic context.
- The search API returns detailed metadata (scores, chunk type, page number) so the UI and external clients can explain why a result ranked.

This foundation underpins every other workflow—transcripts, forensic exports, and future analytics reuse the same infrastructure.
