🚀 We've built a world-class search engine that delivers the speed of keyword search with the intelligence of semantic understanding. LegalEase AI's hybrid search engine is the foundation of our document analysis platform.

By combining BM25 keyword matching with dense vector embeddings, our search engine understands both what you type and what you mean. Search for "breach of contract" and find relevant sections even when they use terms like "contractual violation" or "agreement breach."

**Technical Architecture:**
- ⚡ **BM25 Keyword Search**: Traditional text matching for exact phrases
- 🧠 **Semantic Vector Search**: AI-powered understanding via Sentence Transformers
- 🔄 **Hybrid Fusion**: Intelligent combination of both approaches
- 📊 **Qdrant Vector Database**: High-performance similarity search
- 🎯 **Bounding Box Integration**: Precise location data for visual highlighting
- 💨 **Sub-100ms Latency**: Lightning-fast results (p95)

**Visual Highlighting:** 🎨
When you click a search result, the PDF viewer automatically jumps to the relevant section and highlights it with a precise bounding box. No more hunting through pages—the exact location is shown visually in context.

**Document Processing Pipeline:** 🛠️
We use Docling for advanced document parsing that preserves structure and extracts bounding box coordinates for every text chunk. Tables, sections, paragraphs, and lists are all precisely located and indexed.

**Privacy-First Design:** 🔒
Everything runs locally. Your documents are parsed, embedded, and indexed on your infrastructure using your own PostgreSQL, Qdrant, and MinIO instances. No external API calls, no data sharing.

Experience search the way it should be—fast, intelligent, and completely private! 🔍
